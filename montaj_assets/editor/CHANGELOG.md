## Unreleased

### Carousel editor

- New public `ReadOnlySlide` read-only renderer (with optional auto-fit): a thin
  wrapper over the non-interactive `SlideCanvas` exposing only read-only props,
  optionally measuring its sized parent to fit the slide.
- Crop display in non-interactive render: a committed `ImageElement.crop` now
  renders the cropped sub-rect via the oversized-cover technique (matching the
  renderer) instead of falling back to a plain `object-fit: cover`.
- Google Fonts loading for carousel overlays (`OverlayElement.googleFonts`): the
  carousel overlay render path now loads declared Google Fonts so previews use
  the same glyphs and metrics as the renderer.
